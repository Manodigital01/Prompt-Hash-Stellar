# Versioned event replay for rebuilding projections (#1024)

Projections (read models derived from contract events) can be rebuilt from a
durable event journal without touching the copy that is being served, checked,
switched over atomically and switched back.

Code: `server/src/models/EventJournal.ts`, `server/src/services/eventJournal.ts`,
`server/src/services/projectionReplay.ts`,
`server/src/routes/projectionReplayRoutes.ts`,
`server/scripts/replayProjection.ts`.

## Pieces

- **Event journal** (`EventJournal`): every recognized contract event, with
  its decoded payload and the **event schema version** it was decoded with.
  The indexer appends to it after decoding (and when a quarantined event is
  replayed successfully). Appends are idempotent on `eventId`, and entries
  cannot be updated. `ProcessedEvent` only stores ids, which is why a journal
  was needed.
- **Projection definitions:** pure reducers with a **projection version** and
  the event types and versions they understand. The first one,
  `prompt_listing@v1`, keeps per-prompt creator, asset, price, sale status,
  sales count and revenue from `PromptCreated`, `PromptPurchased`,
  `PromptPriceUpdated` and `PromptSaleStatusUpdated` (v1 and v2).
- **Runs** (`ProjectionRun`): one replay of the journal into an isolated copy
  (`ProjectionDocument`, keyed by `runId`), with checkpoint, counters, lease
  and attempts.
- **Pointer** (`ProjectionPointer`): which completed run is served, plus the
  previous one for rollback. `readActiveProjectionRow(name, key)` reads
  through it.

## Normal flow

```bash
# HTTP (admin token with projections:write / projections:read)
POST /api/admin/projections/prompt_listing/replays   { "mode": "dry_run" }
GET  /api/admin/projections/runs/<runId>             # counts, unsupportedSamples
POST /api/admin/projections/prompt_listing/replays   { "mode": "build" }
POST /api/admin/projections/runs/<runId>/activate

# or the CLI
npm --prefix server run projections:replay -- replay prompt_listing --dry-run
npm --prefix server run projections:replay -- replay prompt_listing
npm --prefix server run projections:replay -- activate <runId>
```

A replay reads the journal in `(ledger, eventId)` order, a page at a time
(`batchSize`, default 500). Rows are written first, then the checkpoint that
covers them.

## Versioning

- **Projection version:** bump it whenever the reducer's output changes. Runs
  record the version they were built with. If the reducer version changes
  while a run is half built, the run fails instead of mixing two reducers'
  rows; start a new run.
- **Event schema version:** each event is classified as:
  - `applied`: the projection understands this type at this version;
  - `ignored`: the projection does not use this event type;
  - `unsupported`: the projection uses the type, but not at this version.

  In **strict** mode (default) the first unsupported event stops the run
  (`status: failed`, error
  `unsupported_version: <type> v<n> at ledger <l> (<eventId>)`), checkpointed
  just before it. Teach the reducer the new version (add it to
  `supportedEvents`, and bump the projection version if its output changes),
  deploy, then **resume**: the run continues from that event. In **lenient**
  mode (`strict: false`) unsupported events are skipped, counted, and up to 20
  are sampled. Such a run **cannot be activated**, so a projection that
  silently dropped events is never served.

## Failure, retry and authorization

- **Failure:** any error (database, reducer) marks the run `failed` with the
  message and releases its lease. The served projection is unaffected.
- **Retry/resume:** `POST /runs/<runId>/resume` or `… resume <runId>`
  continues from the checkpoint. Each row remembers the last event applied to
  it, so if a crash landed after rows were written but before the checkpoint,
  re-processing that page skips events those rows already include. Nothing is
  counted twice. Dry runs keep rows in memory and restart from the beginning
  on resume.
- **Concurrency:** a worker claims a run with a 60 s lease that is renewed
  every page. A second worker gets `409 run_not_claimable` while the lease is
  live. A run whose worker died (expired lease) can be taken over. Completed
  runs cannot be restarted; start a new one.
- **Authorization:** reads need `projections:read`; starting, resuming,
  activating and rolling back need `projections:write`. Starts, activations
  and rollbacks are recorded in the audit trail (`admin_projection_replay`,
  `admin_projection_activate`, `admin_projection_rollback`; all in the `admin`
  export scope).

## Activation and rollback

- Activation requires a **completed build** run with **no unsupported
  events**. It moves the current run to `previousRunId`.
- `POST /api/admin/projections/<name>/rollback` (or `… rollback <name>`) swaps
  the active and previous runs, and is itself reversible by rolling back
  again.
- `… prune <name>` deletes rows of runs that are neither active, previous nor
  still in progress.

## Migration plan

1. **Deploy.** The journal starts empty and new events are journaled as they
   are indexed. Existing collections (`Prompt`, `Purchase`, …) and the indexer
   flow are unchanged. This change also defines the indexer's
   `getEventDecoder`, which was referenced but never defined: before it,
   every event was quarantined as `decoder_error`.
2. **Backfill history** from the chain into the journal (idempotent, safe to
   overlap with the live indexer):
   ```bash
   PUBLIC_STELLAR_RPC_URL=… PUBLIC_PROMPT_HASH_CONTRACT_ID=… \
     npm --prefix server run projections:replay -- backfill --from <deploy ledger>
   ```
   RPC providers retain a limited window of events. For older history, use
   an archive RPC.
3. **Dry run, build, compare, activate.** A dry run first shows counts and
   any unsupported versions. Before switching consumers over, compare a
   sample of rows against the existing collections.
4. **Rollback of the feature:** stop reading through the pointer. The journal
   and run collections can stay (append-only, no effect on other code) or be
   dropped.

## Operational edge cases

- **Journal write failure in the indexer** never stalls indexing. It logs
  `event journal append failed — backfill required for this event` with the
  event id and ledger; backfill that range.
- **Events for a prompt without a creation event** (journal gap) produce a row
  with `incomplete: true` rather than failing. Backfill the gap and rebuild.
- **Ordering:** Soroban event ids are zero-padded and sort correctly within a
  ledger. Entries are processed in `(ledger, eventId)` order.
- **Large rebuilds:** progress is visible on the run (`checkpoint`, `counts`),
  and a worker can be stopped at any time and resumed later.

## Malformed rows, missing checkpoints and apply failures (#905)

Every row is checked before a reducer sees it (`parseReplayEvent`). A row with
an unusable identity (`eventId`, `ledger`) cannot be checkpointed past, so it
stops every mode. Other malformed rows (empty `eventType`, `eventVersion` below
1, non-object `payload`) stop strict runs and are skipped and sampled in lenient
runs. A run that skipped any malformed row cannot be activated.

Each failure is recorded on the run with the event that caused it:

| Error prefix | Cause | Run state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `malformed_event:` | Row fails the shape check | Failed at the checkpoint before the row (strict), or skipped and counted in `counts.malformed` (lenient) |
| `unsupported_version:` | Event version unknown to the reducer | Failed at the checkpoint before the row (strict) |
| `apply_failed:` | Reducer threw on an event | Failed at the checkpoint before that event; nothing after it is applied |
| `checkpoint_event_missing:` | The checkpoint event is no longer in the journal | Failed before any row is written; start a new run |

The checkpoint event is verified before a resumed run applies anything, so a
journal that lost history cannot be rebuilt silently over the gap. Start a fresh
build run after restoring the journal.
