/**
 * Permission-diff reports for role and policy changes (#1036).
 *
 * Every role or policy change is previewed as a deterministic report before
 * it is applied. The report carries a `digest`: SHA-256 over the canonical
 * JSON of the change *and* the state it was computed from. Applying a change
 * requires the caller to echo the digest of the report they reviewed; the
 * server recomputes the report from current state at apply time, so:
 *
 *   - no digest            → `diff_required` (nothing was reviewed)
 *   - digest mismatch      → `stale_diff` (state or request changed since
 *                            review; the caller must re-review the fresh report)
 *
 * The digest is not a secret: it is never trusted, only compared against a
 * value the server derives itself, so it binds "what was reviewed" to "what
 * is applied" without key management.
